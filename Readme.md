# Docker Container for VPN

Rather than running an entire Windows (bloated) virtual machine for accessing VPN endpoints via the "openconnect" tool, here is a Docker container that encapsulates the VPN system as a container.  The objective is to allow you to have a second VPN up while your real machine has a main VPN established. 

Currently it is unknown how to tunnel HTTP*

I think this is rather clever if I may say so ü§ì

Dockerfile:

```
`FROM **fedora**`
`RUN dnf install -y openconnect openssh-clients`
`ADD openvpn /usr/bin/openvpn`
`ENTRYPOINT ["bash", "/usr/bin/openvpn‚Äù]
```

The script ‚Äúopenvpn‚Äù (redacted)

You of course could allow the script to prompt you, but why?  üòâ

```
*#!/bin/sh*`

`*# set -x*`
`endpoint=[gatekeeper-usau.actian.com](http://gatekeeper-usau.actian.com/)`

`[ "$1" = "-p" ] && endpoint=[gatekeeper-uspa.actian.com](http://gatekeeper-uspa.actian.com/)`

`[ "$1" = "-i" ] && endpoint=52.129.114.4`



`(echo ‚ÄòYourDomainPassword';**echo** 2) | openconnect --timestamp --[user=daryl.monge@actian.com](mailto:user=daryl.monge@actian.com) --servercert 'pin-sha256:Khbv7Jx8nBTJC0RS0cJvJTygFy1/iG45Kg+kKuJBBDY=' --authgroup=ACTIAN-CORP $endpoint --passwd-on-stdin`

`while **true**`

`do`

‚Äã    `sleep 86400`

`done
```

Building the container image is as simple as ‚Äúdocker build .‚Äù

Launching the container:

Ignore the errors for now, it still actually works.  I love (sarcasm) stuff like that‚Ä¶.
